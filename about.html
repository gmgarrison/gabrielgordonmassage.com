            <h3 class="align-center">Massage has always been a part of my life.</h3>
            <p>Even when I was very young, if someone in my family was having a tough day, one of my parents or myself
                would offer the other a massage to ease the trouble. </p>
            <p>​Growing up, I continued exchanging massages with close friends at school. After entering the working
                world and performing several years of delivery driving, I knew I would be better suited to doing
                something hands-on.</p>
            <p>While attending Portland's East West College of the Healing Arts, my appreciation for the human body
                blossomed. As my knowledge of kinesiology and physiology increased, so did my awareness of my own
                body.</p>
            <p>Utilizing this new-found fascination, I have been able to harness more flexibility, strength, and
                mindfulness. This in turn led to a great fondness for Traditional Thai Massage, as it involves a
                full-body awareness for both client and therapist.</p>
            <p>After studying Thai bodywork at East West, I continued to offer it there in the Professional Clinic,
                learning more about what it feels like to achieve balance and openness for all parties involved.</p>
            <p>Now, whether it be on the Thai mat or the Massage Table, I strive to bring that balance and openness to
                every session so that it may be truly beneficial to the clients’ person as a whole.</p>
            <p>Along with Thai Massage, I have studied and integrated several styles of bodywork, including Trigger
                Point, Myofascial, Swedish, and Sports Massage. This allows for great specificity in each session.</p>
            <p>Every body is different and every day brings new challenges and opportunities. It is so exciting to have
                so many chances for us to rise up and meet them together!</p>
